Brew & Bloom – Website Project 

Project Overview 

Brew & Bloom is a fictional small business that combines a boutique café with a plant nursery. The website has been developed as part of a web development project to showcase the company’s services, products, and events. 

The site is fully coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on semantic structure, responsive design, and usability. It consists of six main web pages that are interconnected via a consistent navigation system.
